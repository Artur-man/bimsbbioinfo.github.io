The event is for students, postdocs and investigators who are already
making and using bioinformatics tools.  Participants are encouraged to
work on problems related to RNA bioinformatics, though other
bioinformatics research problems are also welcome.

There will also be ready made pitches from RNA bioinformatics domain.
The participants can work on a tool, pipeline and/or a data analysis
problem using public data sets.

## Organization

After a brief brainstorming session individuals or teams will pitch
their ideas.  Teams will be formed (*ad-hoc* or pre-defined) and they
will spend two days making a pipeline or a tool that solves a
bioinformatics problem.  The participants can only use public datasets
for the testing and development.  The hackathon will take place at
IRI, Philippstr. 13, Haus 18 / Top Floor 10115 Berlin.

Coffee and snacks will be provided.


## Products and deliverables 

All pipelines, scripts and software generated in the hackathon should
be added to public GitHub repositories, and the details of those
software and projects will be shared in the hackathon webpage as well
as README files of the repositories.
