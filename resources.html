        Here is a list of software, databases and learning material
        maintained by bioinformatics platform members.<br>

        <br>

        <h3>Databases</h3>
        <h5>doRiNA</h5>
        <p> Dorina is a database for RNA binding protein binding sites
          and microRNAs.<br>

        </p>
        <h3>Software</h3>
        <h5>methylKit</h5>
        <p>methylKit is an R package for DNA methylation analysis and
          annotation from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. The
          package is designed to deal with sequencing data from RRBS and
          its variants, but also target-capture methods such as Agilent
          SureSelect methyl-seq. In addition, methylKit can deal with
          base-pair resolution data for 5hmC obtained from Tab-seq or
          oxBS-seq. It can also handle whole-genome bisulfite sequencing
          data if proper input format is provided.<br>

          This is an R package that contains a collection of tools for
          visualizing and analyzing genome-wide data sets. The package
          works with a variety of genomic interval file types and
          enables easy summary and annotation of high throughput data
          sets with given genomic annotations.<br>
