# Resources

Here is a list of software, databases and learning material maintained
by bioinformatics platform members.


### Databases

##### doRiNA

Dorina is a database for RNA binding protein binding sites and
microRNAs.

### Software

##### methylKit

methylKit is an R package for DNA methylation analysis and annotation
from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. The package is designed to
deal with sequencing data from RRBS and its variants, but also
target-capture methods such as Agilent SureSelect methyl-seq. In
addition, methylKit can deal with base-pair resolution data for 5hmC
obtained from Tab-seq or oxBS-seq. It can also handle whole-genome
bisulfite sequencing data if proper input format is provided.

##### genomation

This is an R package that contains a collection of tools for
visualizing and analyzing genome-wide data sets. The package works
with a variety of genomic interval file types and enables easy summary
and annotation of high throughput data sets with given genomic
annotations.

##### *How to use the BIMSB cluster*
Some specifics about BIMSB cluster

##### *Notes on Computational Genomics with R*
This is a resource developed by Altuna. Currently, included basics of R and genomic interval analysis using R/Bioconductor packages.
