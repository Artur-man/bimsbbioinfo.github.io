# Berlin RNA toolbox
deNBI RNA Bioinformatics Centre Berlin node provides several tools for RNA bioinformatics. The tools provided are listed below. 



doRiNA: a database of RNA interactions in post-transcriptional
regulation

circBase: a database for public circular RNA datasets and tools to discover
circRNAs in RNA-seq data; PicTar: a microRNA target predictor; miRDeep: a probabilistic
model that detects the presence of expressed animal microRNAs in deep sequencing data;

miReduce: a tool to discover motifs in mRNAs which explain changes in gene expression;

PIPmiR: a tool to identify novel plant miRNA genes from a combination of deep sequencing and
genomic features; 

NASTIseq: expression analysis for the identification of cis-Natural Antisense Transcripts (cis-NAT) from strand specific RNA-seq data; 

PARalyzer: a peak finder for protein-
RNA interaction sites in PAR-CLIP data; microMUMMIE: microRNA target-site prediction in PAR-CLIP data

cERMIT: a motif finder for large sequence sets e.g. from chromatin or RNA immunopreciptation experiments.
