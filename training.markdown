# Training

Bioinformatics platform provides training and help-desk services for
BIMSB scientists. We are planning to have Galaxy and R/Bioconductor
training sessions.


---------------------------------------

### Computational genomics course 2016
We are organizing a computional genomics course titled "Computational genomics approaches to precision medicine". The course will take place between 12 and 23 September 2016 in Berlin. The course will include theoretical lectures followed by practical sessions where students directly apply what they have learned. The programming tasks will be mainly done in R and unix. The course will be beneficial for first year computational biology PhD students and experimental biologists who want to begin data analysis or are seeking a better understanding of computational genomics and its applications in precision medicine.

more information to follow...

---------------------------------------

### Bioinformatics walk-in clinics
Bioinformatics platform is offering walk-in clinics to help researchers with their bioinformatics questions and provide discussion. The clinics takes place every 30-45 days, it is announced via e-mail through MDC maillists. 

#### **How it works**
Bring your bioinformatics problems/questions (and data if you have), no appointment needed. We will advise you on how to deal with your problem and/or refer you to other platforms or groups who can best advise you. The format is one-to-one consultation. This is not a course, lecture or a tutorial with a predefined agenda.
Some of the things we can help with are listed below:

* Sequence analysis
* Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data and management 
* Functional genome annotation
* Development and validation of predictive models from data
* Data visualisation and exploratory data analysis
* R programming

---------------------------------------

### R training
We provide basic R training for scientists. Currrently, we offer courses only to BIMSB members. If you are not at BIMSB but interested in those training sessions, go to [contact](contact.html) to request more information.

---------------------------------------

### Unix and SGE training
We provide basic unix and SGE for scientists. Currrently, we offer courses only to BIMSB members. If you are not at BIMSB but interested in those training sessions, go to [contact](contact.html) to request more information.

---------------------------------------

### On demand consulation 
Go to [contact](contact.html) to request bioinformatics related
help-desk services. These services can be scheduled depending on the
demand and availability of Dr. Altuna Akalin.

### Past courses & events

---------------------------------------

#### Internal computational genomics course 2016
We are organizing a computional genomics course for January/February 2016. The course will be open for BIMSB and MDC students and employees. The course content will be similar to compgen2015 course below. If you are interested, please register your interest below.

Registration of interest [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zo0ixPyPZukFcUhUnbgzpvIfrPDkA1eqyHDHM03jIvo/viewform)

#### Computational genomics course 2015
We are organizing a computional genomics course for 18-24 October 2015. The course will include theoretical lectures followed by practical sessions where students directly apply what they have learned. The programming tasks will be mainly done in R. The course will be beneficial for first year computational biology PhD students and experimental biologists who want to begin data analysis or are seeking a better understanding of computational genomics.

---------------------------------------

#### Bioinformatics Hackathon 2015
We are organizing a Bioinformatics Hackathon between 14-15 September 2015. The event is for students, postdocs and investigators who are already making and using bioinformatics tools. Participants are encouraged to work on problems related to RNA bioinformatics, though other bioinformatics research problems are also welcome. There is no restriction on which programming languages or frameworks (such as galaxy) are used for development as long as developed tools are open source.
