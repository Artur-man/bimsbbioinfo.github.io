# Training

Bioinformatics platform provides training and help-desk services for
BIMSB scientists. We are planning to have Galaxy and R/Bioconductor
training sessions.


---------------------------------------

### Computational genomics course
Yearly since 2015 we are organizing a computational genomics course focusing on various topics from special sequencing technologies to machine learning. Before 2020 it took place in Berlin. Since then, the course has been conducted in an online format, facilitating access for interested participants worldwide with minimal obstacles. The courses cover fundamentals in BS-seq analysis, integration and visualization of processed genomics data. 

The course design consists of theoretical lectures followed by practical sessions where students directly apply what they have learned. The programming is mainly done in R and unix shell. 

The course will be beneficial for computational biologists and experimental biologists who are doing data analysis.

### Bioinformatics consulations
Bioinformatics platform is offering consultation servive to help researchers with their bioinformatics questions and provide discussion. The services can be booked over the "Open Iris" system.

#### **How it works**
Bring your bioinformatics problems/questions (and data if you have). We will advise you on how to deal with your problem and/or refer you to other platforms or groups who can best advise you. The format is one-to-one consultation. This is just a consultation service, not "analyze my data" service.
Some of the things we can help with are listed below:

* Sequence analysis
* Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data and management 
* Functional genome annotation
* Development and validation of predictive models from data
* Data visualisation and exploratory data analysis
* R programming

---------------------------------------


### Mentorship
Mentorship is only offered to students/researchers who have basic skills in bioinformatics such as understanding of data types in genomics and some programming. The mentorship is offered for a limited amount of time and with clear learning goals in mind. The goals will be decided in the first meeting with the mentor. The mentors are a point of contact for bioinformatics questions, they will advise on how to do a particular analysis. Keep in mind that mentors are researchers and can only allocate a limited amount of time per week for mentorship activities. There will be an initial meeting for the skill set assessment, this opportunity can not be offered to people who have no bioinformatics skills and/or can not establish clear learning objectives at that meeting. 


---------------------------------------


### Small scale collaboration
A small-scale project is a project where we have specialized expertise, set of existing scripts and experience that can do the job in shorter time-frame.
After initial consultation meeting, it will be decided if the project is suitable for small-scale project, depending on the expertise and the time required to complete it. 
The project must have clear goals and a clear set of questions to be answered. 
These projects will not have open-ended goals and spontaneous derivative analysis that has not been discussed before.


---------------------------------------

### R training
We provide basic R training for scientists. Currrently, we offer courses only to BIMSB members. If you are not at BIMSB but interested in those training sessions, go to [contact](contact.html) to request more information.

---------------------------------------

### Unix and SGE training
We provide basic unix and SGE for scientists. Currrently, we offer courses only to BIMSB members. If you are not at BIMSB but interested in those training sessions, go to [contact](contact.html) to request more information.

---------------------------------------

### On demand consulation 
Go to [contact](contact.html) to request bioinformatics related
help-desk services. These services can be scheduled depending on the
demand and availability of Dr. Altuna Akalin.

### Past courses & events

---------------------------------------

#### Computational genomics course 2016
We are organizing a computional genomics course titled "Computational genomics approaches to precision medicine". The course will take place between 12 and 23 September 2016 in Berlin. The course will include theoretical lectures followed by practical sessions where students directly apply what they have learned. The programming tasks will be mainly done in R and unix. The course will be beneficial for first year computational biology PhD students and experimental biologists who want to begin data analysis or are seeking a better understanding of computational genomics and its applications in precision medicine.

#### Bioinformatics Hackathon 2015
We are organizing a Bioinformatics Hackathon between 14-15 September 2015. The event is for students, postdocs and investigators who are already making and using bioinformatics tools. Participants are encouraged to work on problems related to RNA bioinformatics, though other bioinformatics research problems are also welcome. There is no restriction on which programming languages or frameworks (such as galaxy) are used for development as long as developed tools are open source.
