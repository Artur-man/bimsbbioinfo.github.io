# Training

Bioinformatics platform provides training and help-desk services for
BIMSB scientists. We are planning to have Galaxy and R/Bioconductor
training sessions.

### Bioinformatics walk-in clinics
Bioinformatics platform is offering walk-in clinics to help researchers with their bioinformatics questions and provide discussion. The clinics takes place every 30-45 days, it is announced via e-mail.

**How it works**
Bring your bioinformatics problems/questions (and data if you have), no appointment needed. We will advise you on how to deal with your problem and/or refer you to other platforms or groups who can best advise you. The format is one-to-one consultation. This is not a course, lecture or a tutorial with a predefined agenda.
Some of the things we can help with are listed below:

* Sequence analysis
* Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data and management 
* Functional genome annotation
* Development and validation of predictive models from data
* Data visualisation and exploratory data analysis
* R programming


### R training
We provide basic R training for scientists. Currrently, we offer courses only to BIMSB members. If you are not at BIMSB but interested in those training sessions,go to [contact](contact.html) to request more information.

### Unix and SGE training
We provide basic unix and SGE for scientists. Currrently, we offer courses only to BIMSB members. If you are not at BIMSB but interested in those training sessions,go to [contact](contact.html) to request more information.

### On demand consulation 
Go to [contact](contact.html) to request bioinformatics related
help-desk services. These services can be scheduled depending on the
demand availability of Dr. Altuna Akalin.
